# Unsupervised-Project---Netflix-Movies-and-TV-Shows-Clustering
Understanding what type content is available in different countries. 
If Netflix has been increasingly focusing on TV rather than movies in recent years. 
Clustering similar content by matching text-based features.

## Description

This dataset consists of TV shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset was collected from Flixable, a third-party Netflix search engine. 
In 2018, they released an interesting report that showed the number of TV shows on Netflix had nearly tripled since 2010. 
The streaming serviceâ€™s number of movies had decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows had nearly tripled. 
This project aims to explore what other insights can be obtained from this dataset.

Integrating this dataset with other external datasets such as IMDB ratings and Rotten Tomatoes can provide even more interesting findings.

**Project Objectives**

In this project, we are required to:

1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
2. Understand what types of content are available in different countries.
3. Determine if Netflix has been increasingly focusing on TV shows rather than movies in recent years.
4. Cluster similar content by matching text-based features.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of 7787 entries and 12 columns, including information about show ID, type, title, director, cast, country, date added, release year, rating, duration, listed in, and description.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized into several phases:

1. **Knowing Data:** Understanding the dataset, its columns, and data types.
2. **Data Wrangling:** Preprocessing and cleaning the data for analysis.
3. **Data Visualization:** Creating visualizations to gain insights from the data.
4. **Hypothesis Testing:** Formulating and testing hypotheses based on the data.
5. **Data Preprocessing:** Further data cleaning and preparation for modeling.
6. **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features for analysis.
7. **Text Preprocessing:** Using NLP techniques for text-based features.
8. **Model Implementation:** Applying clustering algorithms to the data.
9. **Models Implemented:** Including Hierarchical Clustering, KMeans, and DBSCAN with cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning for each model.
